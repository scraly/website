# Install Gitpod Self-Hosted

There are two supported methods of installing Gitpod Self-Hosted:

- [Replicated](#using-replicated) â€” the easiest and commercially supported
- [Installer](#using-the-installer) â€” the most flexible

Using [Helm](#using-helm-deprecated) is now deprecated.

## Using Replicated

> ðŸ‘€ **Coming Soon**
>
> We are working on this installation method and will update this page very soon.

## Using the Installer

> ðŸš§ **Under Construction**

> You may find a preliminary version of this section [here](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/blob/main/installer/README.md#quickstart).

## Using Helm (deprecated)

Historically, Helm was used to install Gitpod Self-Hosted. This method is now deprecated but you may still find them here:

- [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](./installation/on-amazon-eks)
- [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](./installation/on-gke)
- [Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](./installation/on-microsoft-aks)
- [Kubernetes](./installation/helm-on-kubernetes)
